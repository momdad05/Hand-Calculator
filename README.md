Virtual Hand Gesture Calculator using OpenCV & MediaPipe
Overview
This project is an AI-powered virtual calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations using hand gestures, without touching the keyboard or mouse.
It uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for real-time visualization and interaction. The calculatorâ€™s buttons are displayed on screen, and users can "press" them using finger pinches (thumb + index finger).

ðŸš€ Features

âœ‹ Hand Tracking: Detects your hand and finger landmarks using MediaPipe.

ðŸ§® Virtual Calculator UI: On-screen calculator built entirely with OpenCV.

ðŸ‘† Gesture-Based Clicks: "Click" buttons by pinching your thumb and index finger.

ðŸ’¡ Smooth Interaction: Real-time hover and click detection with visual feedback.

ðŸ§¾ Expression Evaluation: Supports operations like +, -, *, /, parentheses, and decimal points.

ðŸ”„ Clear & Delete Functions: Reset or delete characters easily.
